Welcome to our presentation and demo on Intelligent Defense: Real-Time Fraud Detection with GenAI and Databricks.
In this session, we will demonstrate how we effectively shield against fraudsters using advanced techniques. Leveraging the power of Generative AI (GenAI) and the robust and versatile analytics platform Databricks, we have developed a cutting-edge solution to detect and prevent fraud in real time.



Page 2 Executive Summary

Telecom fraud is a significant global issue, costing the industry over $28 billion annually through tactics like subscription fraud and account takeovers.
Despite the implementation of advanced technologies, fraudsters are continually adapting, increasing the sophistication of their schemes.
Leveraging cutting-edge GenAI technologies—such as tagging, classification, summarization, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)—within the Databricks platform offers a powerful defense, enabling real-time, scalable, and accurate fraud detection and notification.
Databricks' seamless deployment capabilities, coupled with user-friendly front-end tools like Streamlit, streamline the development and deployment of comprehensive fraud prevention solutions, ensuring telecom operators stay ahead of emerging threats.



Page 3 Product Vision and Strategy

Our vision is to revolutionize telecom fraud prevention by leveraging the power of Generative AI and advanced analytics, ensuring a secure and trustworthy communication ecosystem for all. We have three major target user groups: Telecom Operators, Customer Service Representatives, and Fraud Analysts.
Some key product features include Real-Time Fraud Detection, Fraud Pattern Summarization, and Self-Learning Fraud Detection with a feedback loop, all of which we will demonstrate in our demo.
Our core technology encompasses both Generative AI with Open Source Models and traditional AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Synthetic Transcript Data Generation, Human-in-the-Loop Feedback, Databricks Serving, and Real-Time Queue using Kafka.



Page 4 Architecture Diagram

This is our architecture diagram. We feed call transcripts generated by real-time transcription into our real-time fraud detector, which outputs a fraud probability score, patterns, and other analytics to a real-time dashboard. Operators can view the fraud prediction results in real-time on Streamlit, deployed in Databricks, and provide feedback to the fraud detector engine.
Inside the engine, we use a combination of Generative AI prompt engineering, traditional anomaly detection methods, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect fraud. This combination forms the core of our fraud detection engine. Additionally, we bring in human experts to review cases with borderline scores and confidence levels, allowing them to confirm whether these cases are fraudulent. If confirmed, these fraud cases are added to our knowledge base, which is filled with positive fraud patterns.
Furthermore, we continuously learn from real-world fraud across all industries, generate synthetic patterns, and expand the knowledge base with these synthetic fraud patterns to keep our solution up-to-date.


Demo
In this demo, let's first look at the home page, where we can see a summary of all processed call transcripts and detected fraud cases in October 2024. We also have statistics such as total calls, fraud instances, daily fraud detection rate, and geographical distribution. Additional analytics and reporting features can certainly be added here.
Real-time fraud detection processes simulated turn-by-turn transcripts, runs them through the detection engine, and displays any detected fraud alerts.
The call summarization feature can analyze any historical call transcript. For example, in test case number 1, it generates a fraud detection summary, including a probability score, identified fraud patterns, an explanation of why it’s classified as fraud, and a summary of the entire conversation.
The sentiment analysis feature assesses the sentiment of both the customer and the agent, providing explanations for their respective sentiments.
The feedback feature enables fraud detection experts to conduct human-in-the-loop validation for cases with borderline probabilities and low confidence levels. Experts can reclassify a case as either fraud or not fraud and provide justifications for their decisions. The lower right section also displays feedback distribution, indicating the number of fraud detection results that have been reviewed by human experts.
